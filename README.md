Created with CodeSandbox

This is a Mobile and Desktop responsive Diary App made with ReactJS, Reduxw(react-redux and @reduxjs/toolkit), React Hooks and uses bootstrap for styling. It mainly focuses on front end which is UI and handling data(functionality) and doesn't use API.

Data(.js file) is stored in react store and CRUD operation performs on store.
