      "I woke up at 6 oclock in the morning. We had breakfast and dressed up. Today we all went to Fantasize Amusement park near Pune. We started from home at 7 oclock. As soon as we reached there, we bought our tickets and went inside. I was so excited seeing the rides. My parents and brother liked the Thunderfall ride. My favorite rides were Water Splash, Caterpillar Ride, Wave Pool and Pirate Ship. After a couple of hours, we had our lunch. In the afternoon we had the scariest ride that is the Space Gun. We got back to our home in the evening. It was a great day and I enjoyed a lot.",

      "After I woke up this morning, I made the regrettable decision of waking up. I tried to go back to sleep, but I could not even relax. Today was one of those days where either I get up, or I get up. I then decided to go outside, but because it was raining, I got wet. I went back inside, felt tired enough to go back to bed, but I still had to change out of my wet clothes. Then I got a phone call from you know who. I got so excited that I didn’t care that I was naked, tired, and there was a puddle on the floor. We are going on a date this Friday. I don’t know how I’m going to sleep. What am I going to wear? :naked dance: :singing in the rain: oh diary, one day I’ll look back on this and say remember when I didn’t pay attention to anything but the phone ringing. FINALLY.",

Motherhood is what has kept me away from you for so long, I have so many things to share. Wait, I think baby has got up. I need to go, will share all the things with you some other day hopefully soon. :)",
